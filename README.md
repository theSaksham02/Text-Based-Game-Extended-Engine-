**An extended game engine for the Grand Mansion Escape text adventure** - Developed as part of the Year 1 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) module assessment at the University of Birmingham School of Computer Science.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains the **extended game engine** for the text-based adventure game created in the first assessment. The engine provides:

- 🏗️ Enhanced architecture following OOP principles
- 🔄 Improved game loop and state management
- 🧩 Modular systems for easy expansion
- 🧠 Smarter command parsing
- 📊 Advanced scoring and progression tracking

## ✨ Key Features

- 🗺️ Dynamic map generation
- 🧰 Expanded inventory system
- 🤖 Basic NPC interactions
- ⏱️ Time-based events
- 🔐 Multi-step puzzle support

## 📚 OOP Concepts Implemented

| Concept         | Implementation Example                  | Diagram                      |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Encapsulation** | `private String name;` with getters/setters | 🔒 Data hiding with access control |
| **Inheritance**  | `public class Enemy extends Character` | 🧬 `Character` → `Enemy` hierarchy |
| **Polymorphism** | Different `Command.execute()` behaviors | ♻️ Single interface, multiple forms |
| **Composition**  | `Room` contains `List<Item>` objects    | � "Has-a" relationship |
| **SOLID** Principles | Single-responsibility classes       | ✨ Each class does one thing well |
